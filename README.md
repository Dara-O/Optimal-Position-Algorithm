# Optimal-Position-Algorithm
An attempt to develop an algorithm that optimizes the location of objects (called servers) that interact with other objects (called nodes) within a predefined range. 

### Glosary
- **Server**: An object that distributes a resources or interacts in some way with other objects within a specified (circular) range.
- **Node**  : An object that recieves a resources or requires some interaction.
- **Radius**: The "distance" around a server that determines how far away nodes can be before they are no longer served by the server.
- **Most connected object/node: The node that has the highest number of nodes within a specified radius. This radius is the same as the radius defined above.   

### Demonstration
39 Nodes, 9 Servers

### Supposed Applications:
- In general, any application that requires the distribution of resources within a limited range may benefit from this algorithm like this one. For example, this algorithm can help optimize the positions ofâ€¦
  - surveillance drones used in disaster management endeavors like wildfire fighting.
  - wireless-communication infrastructure like cell-towers.
  - electrical substations
  - COVID-19 vaccination clinics
